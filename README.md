# MusicBot

## What does it do?

It plays music in a plug.dj "request" style and if nothing is left it will play through a list of existing songs!

## How do I set it up?

Install Python here - https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install Git here - https://git-scm.com/download/win

make sure you select this option in the Python install - https://i.gyazo.com/2c06a7ee35afda3383185916fd2a94d3.png

and this option in the Git install - https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/129489631539494912/129505383223001088/pic.png

It was coded in 3.5.1 but 3.5 will work fine.


Make sure you have installed the required modules by running `fixnupdate.bat`

Make sure you meet the non-code requirements of having existing accounts for
both discord.

##Options.txt set up

Line 1: Email address

Line 2: Password

Line 3: accepts "0" or "1", enables or disables the whitelist. 0 turning it off, 1 turning it on

Line 4: the number of days until a person can freely interact with the bot and not be on the whitelist

Line 5: The Owner's User ID

Line 6: The number of votes to skip for it to actually skip


## What are its commands?

`!whatismyuserid` will tell you your user ID!

`!whitelist @username` will whitelist people (and you if the server is new!) so they can play music

`!blacklist @username` will disallow a person from interacting with the bot!

`!play help` will summon a list of commands accepted by the bot!

`!play url` will allow me to play a new song or add it to the queue.

`!play playlist` will print out all links to youtube videos currently in the queue!

`!play pause` will pause the playing of music! Will NOT pause the song but rather the playing of songs. Only usable by the bot's owner

`!play resume` will resume the playing of songs! Only usable by the bot's owner

`!play shuffle` will shuffle the songs in the playlist! Only usable by the bot's owner

`!play skip` will make it skip to the next song after 2 people vote! Instant skip though if used by the Bot's Owner

`!play volume level` will change the volume level! Default is 0.15 (15%) **HAS TO BE A NUMBER FROM 0-1**

## Sounds cool, How do I use it?
Simply download the bot, set everything up, then run `runbot.bat`!

It'll let you know if it's connected and what channels are connected.

Once started, its good to go. If you have any errors, report them here or on my discord and then restart the bot
